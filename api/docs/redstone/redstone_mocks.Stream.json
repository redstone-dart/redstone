{"name":"Stream","qualifiedName":"redstone/redstone_mocks.Stream","comment":"<p>A source of asynchronous data events.</p>\n<p>A Stream provides a sequence of events. Each event is either a data event or\nan error event, representing the result of a single computation. When the\nStream is exhausted, it may send a single \"done\" event.</p>\n<p>You can <a>redstone/redstone_mocks.Stream.listen</a> on a stream to receive the events it sends. When you listen,\nyou receive a <a>redstone/dart-async.StreamSubscription</a> object that can be used to stop listening,\nor to temporarily pause events from the stream.</p>\n<p>When an event is fired, the listeners at that time are informed.\nIf a listener is added while an event is being fired, the change\nwill only take effect after the event is completely fired. If a listener\nis canceled, it immediately stops receiving events.</p>\n<p>When the \"done\" event is fired, subscribers are unsubscribed before\nreceiving the event. After the event has been sent, the stream has no\nsubscribers. Adding new subscribers after this point is allowed, but\nthey will just receive a new \"done\" event as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Streams always respect \"pause\" requests. If necessary they need to buffer\ntheir input, but often, and preferably, they can simply request their input\nto pause too.</p>\n<p>There are two kinds of streams: The normal \"single-subscription\" streams and\n\"broadcast\" streams.</p>\n<p>A single-subscription stream allows only a single listener during the whole\nlifetime of the stream.\nIt holds back events until it gets a listener, and it may exhaust\nitself when the listener is unsubscribed, even if the stream wasn't done.</p>\n<p>Single-subscription streams are generally used for streaming parts of\ncontiguous data like file I/O.</p>\n<p>A broadcast stream allows any number of listeners, and it fires\nits events when they are ready, whether there are listeners or not.</p>\n<p>Broadcast streams are used for independent events/observers.</p>\n<p>Stream transformations, such as <a>redstone/redstone_mocks.Stream.where</a> and <a>redstone/redstone_mocks.Stream.skip</a>, always return\nnon-broadcast streams.
